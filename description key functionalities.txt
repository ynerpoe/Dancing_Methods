The MATLAB code performs several data processing and analysis tasks. Here's a description of the key functionalities:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
* Reads a CSV file named "file_name.csv" into a table (`messyTable`).
* Handles missing values by treating specified values as missing.
* Identifies rows with missing values and creates a table (`missingValuesTable`) containing those rows.
* Standardizes missing values in `messyTable` to -99.
* Fills missing values in `messyTable` using the "nearest" interpolation method, creating `filledTable`.

2. Data Visualization:
* Extracts specific columns from `filledTable` for further processing (columns related to the positions of different body parts over time).
* Plots the positions of various body parts on the y-axis over time in two subplots, providing visualizations for S1 and S2.

3. Cross-Correlation:
* Computes and plots the cross-correlation between the positions of two body parts (`fhx2` and `ghx2`).

4. Wavelet Analysis:
* Performs a wavelet coherence analysis between the positions of two body parts (`fhx2` and `ghx2`).
* Computes the mean wavelet coherence and saves it to a file (`mean_wcoh`).
* Plots the wavelet coherence with a specified sample rate.

5. Power Calculation:
* Computes the power of the wavelet coherence and calculates the mean power.
* Transposes and saves the mean power to a file (`mean_power`).

6. Phase Analysis:
* Calculates the phase of the wavelet cross-spectrum and converts it to degrees.
* Unwraps the phase for further analysis.
* Sets a significance level (`alpha`).

7. Data Export:
* Writes the filled and processed data to a new CSV file named "filledTable1.csv".
